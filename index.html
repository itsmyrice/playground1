          <p>
            A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
            structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division
            Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering
            plants consist of a few haploid cells that produce gametes. The
            "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed
            within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within
            the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on
            the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may
            self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or
            a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to
            prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen
            is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of
            another flower on a different individual of the same species.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and
            butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and
            have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies,
            including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents,
            and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[2] In
            this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to
            be mutually dependent on services they provide to one anotherâ€”in the
            plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a
            source of food.[3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower
            develops into fruit containing seeds. Flowers have long been
            appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also
            hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic
            objects, or sources of medicine and food.

          <p>
            The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the
            individual and the species. All flowering plants are heterosporous,
            that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores.
            Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers and megaspores
            are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary. Anthers
            typically consist of four microsporangia and an ovule is an
            integumented megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into
            gametophytes inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous plants, the
            gametophytes also develop inside the spores, i. e., they are
            endosporic.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the majority of plant species, individual flowers have both
            functional carpels and stamens. Botanists describe these flowers as
            perfect or bisexual, and the species as hermaphroditic. In a
            minority of plant species, their flowers lack one or the other
            reproductive organ and are described as imperfect or unisexual. If
            the individual plants of a species each have unisexual flowers of
            both sexes then the species is monoecious. Alternatively, if each
            individual plant has only unisexual flowers of the same sex then the
            species is dioecious.

            History shows that flowers have been used by humans for thousands of
            years, to serve a variety of purposes. An early example of this is
            from about 4,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt, where flowers would be
            used to decorate women's hair. Flowers have also inspired art time
            and time again, such as in Monet's Water Lilies or William
            Wordsworth's poem about daffodils entitled: "I Wandered Lonely as a
            Cloud".

          <h3>Giving</h3>
          <p>
            The flower-giving tradition goes back to prehistoric times when
            flowers often had a medicinal and herbal attributes. Archaeologists
            found in several grave sites remnants of flower petals. Flowers were
            first used as sacrificial and burial objects. Ancient Egyptians and
            later Greeks and Romans used flowers. In Egypt, burial objects from
            the time around 1540 BC[citation needed] were found, which depicted
            red poppy, yellow Araun, cornflower and lilies. Records of flower
            giving appear in Chinese writings and Egyptian hieroglyphics, as
            well as in Greek and Roman mythology. The practice of giving a
            flower flourished in the Middle Ages when couples showed affection
            through flowers. The tradition of flower-giving exists in many
            forms. It is an important part of Russian culture and folklore. It
            is common for students to give flowers to their teachers. To give
            yellow flowers in a romantic relationship means break-up in Russia.
            Nowadays, flowers are often given away in the form of a flower
            bouquet.
